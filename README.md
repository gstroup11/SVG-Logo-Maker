  ## Usage

  The main intent of this application is to create a SVG logo for a developers use in their project.  To start this make sure you have the necessary dependancies from the install section.  Once you complete that section you can then begin to run the application as it is fairly simple.  Run *node index.js* in your terminal and then you will be prompted with a series of questions.  Fill them out to your liking and then press enter.  You should then have a SVG file generated within your main directory.  If you open with live server your image will be available to you in your browser. Refer to this video for further directions.
